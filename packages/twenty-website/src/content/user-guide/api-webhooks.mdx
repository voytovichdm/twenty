## API Keys

API keys allow automated access to your CRM data, synchronize data with other systems, and create custom integrations or solutions. 

For example, you can use them to retrieve details of a specific `Person` or `Company` record, such as their name or address.

## generate an API key

1. Go to Settings in the sidebar on the left.
2. Under Workspace, go to Developers. Here, you'll see a list of active keys that you or your team have created.
3. To generate a new key, click on `+ Create key` on the top right. 
4. Give your API key a name, an expiration date, and a logo.
5. Hit save to see your API key. 
6. Since the key is only visible once, make sure you store it somewhere safe. 

<div class="warning">
Since your API key give access to sensitive information, you shouldn't share it with services you don't fully trust. If leaked, someone can use it maliciously. If you think your API key is no longer secure, make sure you disable it and generate a new one.  
</div>


## Regenerating API key

To regenerate an API key, click on the key you want to regenerate. You'll then be able to see a button to regenerate the API key.

2. Enter your URL.
3. Click Save.

## Delete Webhooks

1. In Developers, find your webhook.
2. Click on your webhook and then press Delete to remove it. A confirmation popup will appear to confirm.
