# About Fields

Fields in an object are like column names in an Excel spreadsheet, indicating the type of stored data like text, numbers, or dates under a specific name. These fields can be standard (created by default) or custom (user-created).

# Standard Fields

## About

Standard Fields are predefined fields included by default. They are delivered as part of the platform and are designed to serve common, universal requirements in business modeling.

As an example, "First Name" and "Last Name" are standard fields within the `people object`. They are text fields, meant to capture and store the respective names of individuals. 

As essential parts of the data model, they cannot be deleted, but only deactivated.

# Custom Fields

## About

A `Custom Field` is a user-defined attribute that can be added to a standard or custom object to store specific information that is not captured by the default fields. These fields can carry different types of data such as text, number, date, Select values, etc. Custom fields allow you to tailor your database to the unique needs of your business, ensuring that all necessary data points are captured and conveniently accessible.

For instance, a custom field for SpaceX could be "Rocket Active Status", indicating if a rocket is currently operational.

## Creating a Custom Field

To add a custom field to any object, follow these steps:
	1.	Go to `Settings` in the sidebar on the left.
	2.	Got to `Data Model`, then select the object you wish to customize.
	3.	Proceed by clicking on `Add Field`.
	4.	Choose a field name and type that suits your requirements. Consider adding a field description for better understanding.

Your newly created field is now available within the app fields. To display it on a specific view, click on the options menu, then select "Fields".

For creating `Custom Fields` in a more expeditious manner, make use of the **+** button located in the top right of the chosen object table, and then select the Customize fields option. This pathway offers you quick access to the Data Model Settings page.

# Deactivate a field

You can deactivate a field in the app to stop it from functioning without disrupting your data model. Deactivation is like a soft deletion, making the field unavailable for use in the app.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Locate the field you wish to deactivate. You'll find these under various object sections.

2. To the right of the line, three vertically aligned dots symbolize a menu button. Click on this to unveil a dropdown list of options.

3. In the dropdown menu, find and click on the "deactivate" option.

And, voila! You've successfully deactivated a field. But what does this mean for your CRM operations?

1. **In-App Functionality:** A deactivated field will no longer function within the app. You won't be able to assign values to these fields anymore.

2. **Relation Fields:** If the deactivated field happens to be a relation field, the system doesn't delete the existing relation. However, it does stop you from assignment or linking records to each other via this field in the app moving forward.

3. **API:** Deactivated Fields and their data can still be utilized through the API.

Standard and Custom Fields can be reactivated. Custom fields also offer the choice of permanent deletion.
