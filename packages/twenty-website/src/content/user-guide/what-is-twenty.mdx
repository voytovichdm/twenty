# What's Twenty?

Twenty is the #1 open-source CRM. 

We are creating a highly customizable CRM powered by a community of hundreds of contributors.

All businesses are unique, and so should their CRMs be.

# Our vision and mission

Great companies often start with bets that seem like long shots. Only later do they appear as no-brainers. Searching the web through a text field, not a directory; letting strangers stay in your home; renting server space like a utility...

Open Source is less than 0.01% of CRM today.

Our bet is that Open Source will ultimately dominate CRM market share.

The open source tide has been rising for some time already, following a simple rule: the closer to the developer stack, the higher the market share of open source.
