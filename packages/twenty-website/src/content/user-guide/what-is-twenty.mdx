# What's Twenty

Twenty stands as the number one open-source CRM, built by a community of hundreds of contributors to offer a highly adaptable solution. Every business is unique, and so their CRM should be.

# Vision and mission

Great companies often start with bets that seem like long shots. Only later do they appear as no-brainers. Searching the web through a text field, not a directory; letting strangers stay in your home; renting server space like a utility...

Open Source is a marginal part of CRM today. Our bet is that Open Source will ultimately dominate CRM market share.

The open source tide has been rising for some time already, following a simple rule: the closer to the developer stack, the higher the market share of open source.
