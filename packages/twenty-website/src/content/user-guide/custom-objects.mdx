Custom objects are objects that you can create to store information that is unique to your organization. They are not built-in; members of your workspace can create and customize custom objects to hold information that standard objects aren't suitable for. For example, if you're SpaceX, you may want to create a custom object for Rockets and Launches.    

# Creating a new custom object 

To create a new custom object:

1. Go to Settings in the sidebar on the left.
2. Under Workspace, go to Data model. Here you'll be able to see an overview of all your existing Standard and Custom objects (both active and disabled).


<div style={{padding:'71.24% 0 0 0', position:'relative'}}>
  <iframe 
    src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/926288174?autoplay=1&loop=1&autopause=0&background=1&amp;app_id=58479" 
    frameborder="0" 
    allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" 
    style={{
      position:'absolute',
      top:0,
      left:0,
      width:'100%',
      height:'100%',
      borderRadius: '16px', 
      border:'2px solid black'
    }}
    title="Export data"
  ></iframe>
</div>
<script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

3. Click on `+ New object` at the top, then choose Custom as the object type. Enter the name (both singular and plural), choose an icon, and add a description for your custom object and hit Save (at the top right). Using Listing as an example of custom object, the singular would be "listing" and the plural would be "listings" along with a description like "Listings that hosts created to showcase their property."

<div style={{padding:'75% 0 0 0', position:'relative'}}>
  <iframe 
    src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/926293493?autoplay=1&loop=1&autopause=0&background=1&amp;app_id=58479" 
    frameborder="0" 
    allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" 
    style={{
      position:'absolute',
      top:0,
      left:0,
      width:'100%',
      height:'100%',
      borderRadius: '16px', 
      border:'2px solid black'
    }}
    title="Export data"
  ></iframe>
</div>
<script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

4. Once you create your custom object, you'll be able to manage it. You can edit the name, icon and description, view the different fields, and add more fields.
