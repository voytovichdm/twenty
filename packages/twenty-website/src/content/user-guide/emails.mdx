Enhance your communication and keep your inbox connected with our **Emails** feature. This guide explains how to synchronize a Gmail mailbox.

# Email synchronization

Emails from known contacts are synced automatically to their CRM records, ensuring all communication is up to date. We do not sync emails from non-personal addresses (e.g., team@, support@) or from personal email providers like Gmail or Outlook to maintain privacy and relevance.

## Read an email

Go to a particular `Person` or `Company` record page, then choose the `Emails` tab to view synced emails instantly. Click on an email to open it.

Customize how you share and manage your emails through the settings. 

# Mailbox Settings

## Connect a new mailbox

To connect a Gmail mailbox, Go to `Settings` > `Accounts` then click the `Add account` button. You can add multiple mailboxes to your account.

After connecting a mailbox, visit the `Emails` tab and select the desired mailbox to customize its settings.

The initial import may take a while, followed by automatic updates every 10 minutes.

## Sharing Levels

From there, you will be able to choose between different levels of sharing for outbound and inbound emails:

- **Metadata Only**: Share only the email's basic information (sender, recipient, date, and time).
- **Subject and Metadata**: Share the email's subject line in addition to its metadata.
- **All Email Content**: Share the full content of the email, including attachments.

## Contacts Auto-creation

Contact auto-creation is a built-in convenience. This default feature auto-adds email contacts not already in your CRM. It boosts your contact list without you lifting a finger. To manage this feature, go to `Settings` > `Email`. You can toggle it on or off. Remember, turning it off means all new email contacts must be manually entered in the CRM.

In the near future, you will be able to send emails, view attachments, and request access to email content you cannot see.
