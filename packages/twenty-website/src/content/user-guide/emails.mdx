# Email synchronization

The system links emails from known contacts directly to their CRM records to keep all communication up to date. It's important to avoid syncing emails from non-personal addresses (for example: team@, support@) or from personal email providers like Gmail or Outlook to ensure privacy and relevance.

## Read an email

Go to a particular `Person` or `Company` record page, then choose the `Emails` tab to view synced emails instantly. Click on an email to open it.

Customize how you share and manage your emails through the settings. 

# Mailbox Settings

## Connect a new mailbox

To connect a Gmail mailbox, Go to `Settings` > `Accounts` then click the `Add account` button. You can add several mailboxes to your account.

After connecting a mailbox, visit the `Emails` tab and select the desired mailbox to customize its settings.

The initial import may take a while, followed by automatic updates every ten minutes.

## Sharing Levels

From there, you will be able to choose between different levels of sharing for outbound and inbound emails:

- **Metadata Only**: Share only the email's basic information (sender, recipient, date, and time).
- **Subject and Metadata**: Share the email's subject line and metadata.
- **All Email Content**: Share the full content of the email, including attachments.

## Contacts Auto-creation

Contact auto-creation is a built-in convenience. This default feature auto-adds email contacts not already in your CRM. It boosts your contact list without you lifting a finger. To manage this feature, go to `Settings` > `Email`. You can toggle it on or off. Remember, turning it off means all new email contacts must be manually entered in the CRM.

Soon, you will be able to send emails, view attachments, and request access to email content you're not allowed to read.
