# About Views

You can see your records in different ways by creating views. In a view, you can apply filters and sorts to organize your content efficiently. For instance, on the `People` object, you can create a view to 
isolate US contacts by filtering those with a US phone number.

## Default Views

Each object comes with an unfiltered, unsorted, and undeletable view known as the Default view. It is named after the object's plural name, such as "All Companies," "All People," "All Opportunities".


# Creating, Editing and Deleting Views

You're free to create numerous custom views, all of which will be shared with your team.

## Creating a View

There is two ways to create a new view. Either directly from the `View Switcher`, either filtering and sorting an existing view.

### From View Switcher

1. Open the View Switcher
2. Click the `Add View` button at the bottom of the view switcher menu.
3. Choose an Icon and name for your View.
4. Choose a "View type" between Table and Kanban. 
5. (Kanban Views only) Choose the Select field you want to pick as column header for your Kanban view. If your object doesn't already have a `Select field` you will be prompted to create one from the Settings before being able to create a Kanban view.
6. Finally, click "Create" to generate your new view.

### From Sorting and Filtering

When you modify the `Sorting` and `Filtering` of an existing view, a `Save as new view` button will appear at the right edge of the `View Bar`. This will opens the New View menu mentionned above, allowing you to create a new view out of an existing one.
