# About Kanban Views

Kanban views visually map out process flows, where each column stands for a distinct stage and each card represents a record.

# Move Cards between Stages

 You can move each card between stages as it goes through your workflow by dragging and dropping. Simply hold your click on a card and move it to the next stage.

# Add and delete stages

You can tailor your workflow to suit your needs using stages, which represent a value in a Select Field:

## Add Stages

To add a stage, access the Select Field Settings by navigating to Settings > Data Model, selecting your object, and then the field your Kanban board depends on.

## Remove Stages

To remove a stage, hover over the stage name or the `â‹®` icon, click `Edit from settings` in the Select Field settings, and then click <b>Delete</b> next to the relevant stage.

# Display fields 

You can configure your Kanban board to display some fields and hide others. To hide a field, click on <b>Options</b> on the top right, then on <b>Fields</b> to bring up the list of options. Hover the field you want to hide to bring up the `-` button. Click on it to hide the field.  

You can also rearrange the order of fields by holding down the field name and dragging it to where you want it.

# Compact View

You can also hide all the fields, and get an overview of all the opportunities at a glance. To do so, click on <b>Options</b> on the top right and turn on the toggle in front of the <b>Compact view</b> option.
